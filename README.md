# Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an eCommerce dataset to derive actionable business insights. The dataset includes information about customers, products, and transactions. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior, product performance, and sales.

---

## Datasets
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **Customers.csv**:
   - Contains customer details such as `CustomerID`, `Region`, and `SignupDate`.
2. **Products.csv**:
   - Includes product information such as `ProductID`, `Category`, and `Price`.
3. **Transactions.csv**:
   - Records transaction details like `TransactionID`, `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `Quantity`, and `TotalValue`.

---

## Key Deliverables
1. **Cleaned Datasets**:
   - `Cleaned_Customers.csv`
   - `Cleaned_Products.csv`
   - `Cleaned_Transactions.csv`

2. **EDA Code**:
   - `FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.

3. **Business Insights Report**:
   - `FirstName_LastName_EDA.pdf`: A PDF document summarizing the key findings and recommendations derived from the analysis.
